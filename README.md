## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

As a person who loves to test my own knowledge I created this trivia app by fetching questions/answers from an API. It's a simple game with varying difficulties that can truly test anyones knowledge. So do you think you "Know It All"?

## Optimizations

Currently the game grabs questions from a wide range of categories, but I would like to eventually add the funcionality to choose a speicfic category or to have it be completely shuffled.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to shuffle arrays of items efficiently by utilizing the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. This was necessary because the data was always retrived with the correct answer being the first choice so with this algorithm in place, I was able to shuffle all this data.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
